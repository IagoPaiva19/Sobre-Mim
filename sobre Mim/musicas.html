                <span>Lorna Shore- To the Hellfire</span>
                <p>Fall with me into the other night
                    <br>We can go beyond the horizon again<br>
                    Fall with me until we're out of time
                   <br>Let the current swallow</p>

                <span>Raining Blood- Slayer</span>
                <p>Raining blood
                    From a lacerated sky
                   <br> Bleeding its horror
                   <br> Creating my structure
                   <br> Now I shall reign in blood</p>

                <span> Stuck in Admiration- Pouya </span>
                <p>Take away my pain and let me live another day
                   <br> Hopin' by tomorrow, I can make it through the rain
                    <br> We struggle with depression, drown myself in novocaine
                    <br> 'Cause everybody wanna be numb
                   <br> And everybody wanna be someone, yuh
                   <br> When the world is fallin' down around me, how can I keep myself up?
                   <br> Feel that pressure on my chest, it's startin' to build up
                   <br> Yuh, don't feel like myself again
                   <br> All these thoughts I keep within
                   <br> Keep it real, can't play pretend</p>

                <span> Frailty - Zillakami</span>
                <p>Frailty, touch the demons with your hand
                   <br> To see the skin they're hidin' in
                   <br> Frailty, sacrifice to prove your faith</p>

                <span>Bad Trip - Derek Pope</span>
                <p>     Here we go again
                   <br> And again
                   <br> And again
                   <br> It seems like all we lose
                   <br> Are friends in the end
                   <br> It was just a dream
                   <br> You never have to share
                   <br> But keep getting stuck in nightmares
                   <br> That could tell the truth or dare
                   <br> To be scared
                   <br> To be who you really are</p>

                    <br> É só poesia
                    <br> Eu só preciso ter você
                    <br> Por mais um dia
                    <br> Ainda gosto de dançar
                    <br> Bom dia
                    <br> Como vai você?</p>

                <p>Yo visto así, no me voy a cambiar
                    <br> Si no te gusta, no tienes que mirar
                    <br> Yo visto así, no me voy a cambiar
                    <br> Me pongo lo que quiera, tú no lo va' a paga</p>

                <p>      And I'm living off of grass
                    <br> And the drippings from my ceiling
                    <br> It's okay to eat fish
                    <br> 'Cause they don't have any feelings</p>
